california.21.d: "Mace's kazoo drops to the floor and he went to grab it for a second. A second. A precious second was all it took for the leading Terrorist to suppress Mace out of that position. This caught Spaceman off-guard, who attacked preemptively and died. Now Mace needs to look for better position. He retreated down ramp and comes at a cross-roads between tunnels or taking the vent up to mini. Perhaps, the Terrorists chose to go to hell instead."
