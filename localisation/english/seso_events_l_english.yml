california.14.t: "CS:GO de_nuke Competitive Match: Terrorists Win"

california.15.t: "CS:GO de_nuke Competitive Match: Deep Garage"
california.15.d: "Mace settles deep inside garage out of easy view from marshmellow and T outside. He makes sure no one crosses into mini. His only blindspot is secret. But hopefully the Terrorists were planning to take A-site instead."

#california.16.t: "CS:GO de_nuke Competitive Match: Terrorists Win"
california.16.d: "And he guessed right. The Terrorists were huddled towards mini. Mace calls it out and Ryder prepares to engage them as soon as they enter. However, Mace's incredible aim took them down, one by one, like dominos."

#california.17.a: "NOOOOOOOO"
california.18.t: "CS:GO de_nuke Competitive Match: Ramp"
california.18.d: "Quite unusual for the Maceman, he appears in ramp to support Spaceman. Spaceman already holds in T funny with his funny sawed-off shotgun. This leaves sniper box open for Mace. Otherwise, Mace can leave Space to his own devices and travel to tunnels. From there, he can deliver a punishing blow from any rushers from Secret."

california.18.b: "Go to Tunnels"
california.19.t: "CS:GO de_nuke Competitive Match: Ramp"

#california.20.t: "CS:GO de_nuke Competitive Match: Joe Rogan Gaming Wins!"
california.20.d: "Mace sees his shot. He left-clicks. The Terrorist lead falls. However, they fire back. Mace moves to the other side of the box, ready to engage at the doorway. As soon as the Terrorists appear, Spaceman appears and lands his three times collateral with a sawed-off. \"who was that faggot in ramp\" an opponent texted after the round."
#california.20.a: "YESSSSS"
california.21.t: "CS:GO de_nuke Competitive Match: Ramp"
california.21.d: "Mace's kazoo drops to the floor and he went to grab it for a second. A second. A precious second was all it took for the leading Terrorist to suppress Mace out of that position. This caught Spaceman off-guard, who attacked preemptively and died. Now Mace needs to look for better position. He retreated down ramp and comes at a cross-roads between tunnels or taking the vent up to mini. Perhaps, the Terrorists chose to go to hell instead."
california.21.a: "Go to Tunnels"
california.21.b: "Go to Mini"
california.22.t: "CS:GO de_nuke Competitive Match: Tunnels"
california.22.d: "Alright, here's hoping the Terrorists take the bait and move to secret. Afterall, no one expects a rat in tunnels."
california.22.a: "Watch Secret"
#california.23.t: "CS:GO de_nuke Competitive Match: Joe Rogan Gaming Wins!"
california.23.d: "BAM, BAM, BAM, and that's three down already. The powerful lurk into tunnels saved Joe Rogan Gaming this match."
#california.23.a: "YESSSSS"
#california.24.t: "CS:GO de_nuke Competitive Match: Terrorists Win"
california.24.d: "A really gay moan was heard over Mace's voice chat. Sag was killed. It appeared that the Terrorists have taken to heaven to capture A site. Ryder is malding that no one called it. Another bristling loss for Joe Rogan Gaming."
#california.24.a: "NOOOOOOOO"
