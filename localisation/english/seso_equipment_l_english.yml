VIA_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Germany in the 1930s. Design of the Panzer I began in 1932 and mass production began in 1934. Intendedonly as a training tank to introduce the concept of armored warfare to the German Army, the PzKpfw I was used extensively in combat due to a lack of more modern tanks."

VIA_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Panzer II"
VIA_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Panzer II was originally designed as a stopgap while larger, more advanced tanks were developed, but it saw extensive use in combat due to a lack of more capable tanks."

 VIA_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Panzer III"
 VIA_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."
VIA_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
 VIA_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Panzer IV"
 VIA_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armor - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

 VIA_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Germany in World War II from mid-1943 to the end of the European war in 1945. It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II."

 VIA_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Jagdpanzer IV served in the anti-tank sections of Panzer and SS Panzer divisions. They fought in Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge and on the Eastern Front. They were very successful tank destroyers but performed badly when used out of role as substitutes for tanks or assault guns, as most tank destroyers were. In the later stages of the war however, they were increasingly used as tank substitutes, because there was often nothing else available."

 VIA_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Known under the informal name Königstiger but, often semi-literally translated as the King Tiger by Allied soldiers, the design followed the same concept as the Tiger I, but was intended to be even more formidable. The Tiger II combined the thick armor of the Tiger I with the sloped armor used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed almost seventy metric tons, was protected by 100 to 180mm of armor to the front and was armed with the long barreled 8.8 cm Kampfwagenkanone 43 L/71 gun."
